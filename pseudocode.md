iteration 0:some html
start with writing some html. 
get a page written that takes the users name (maybe using a prompt? or a popup statement in chrome?)
plan for a banner accross the top taht keeps track of the players wins, the cpu's wins, and the amount of tie games
maybe a restart in the top corner if that is feasible without deleting the score
make a container with 9 boxes. 

iteration 1:some css and some js
the boxes can be set as buttons which will display a player emoji when clicked
upon a win, tie, or loss put out a box on the bottom that states the outcome followed by a 5 second retart timer
reseach how to program in timers. make it visible in the page
write that the variable of the plays name is stored when entered into the prompt so it can be used later

iteration 2:more js
add functions for the buttons. also program in the winning values for tic tac toe so the game checks after 6 moves to see if there is going to be a winner.
making it so it doesnt checkuntil 6 moves have been played should help with workload
how do i program in it counting turns? research this

iteration 3:even more js
once game compelteion occurs, incrememnt up the variable that is the game scores (ties, wins, losses). make sure the game stops when a win occurs. maybe you can use break?
random number generator should be used (between 1 and 9) to decide where the ai puts its emoji. program in that it will reroll if it lands on a spot already taken. 
after game is compelte, show timer that will count down from 5 seconds to then restart. make sure all variables are saved for every play of the game!

iteration 4:html and css polish
just make everything more seemless in css and html. 
no clue how to do this until im at this stage

iteration 5:
look up how to use local storage. 
not sure how this will work with the player name, specifically for eventually entering in a new player name
but it would be cool if scores would be kept on page refresh
defintiely save this impleemntation for last, in case i fuck something up

iteration 6:
refactor the js to be two different js files; main and domUpdates
not sure what this means
