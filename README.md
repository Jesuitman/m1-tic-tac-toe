## 💭 Abstract
This is a friendly game of tictactoe that can be playable with two players. I had originally planned to make it vs the computer and that is something i would like to do down the road, but for now this is making me happy. when you play it make sure you try to see what happens when you get a draw! I have added functionality for three buttons on the page which all do fairly unique things when pressed. give them a shot! but I would hold off if you have a seizure disorder

## 🍎 Context
I spent a few long nights working on this straight, but because i wast have several breakthroughs I did not feel it necessary to slow down or mitigate my workload. I achieved almost all of the goals i set out to do on this project, even doing one of the extensions. I hope to hear back from teachers on how to do the second part

## 🖇️ Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
event delegation to handle similar event listeners
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## 🎆 Wins && 🔥 Challenges#
My biggest win was making the draw game functionality. I had a full on belly laugh for several minutes because of how happy i was to finally get it

## 📝 Observations && ❓ Questions
This project defintiely seemed daunting at first but wasnt too bad thankfully! i was pretty worried starting it out but was able to complete it and produce something im proud of 

# Github Questions
I do not have many github questions, the biggest thing was that i noticed the bit about PR templates late into my production. would it have been wise to go back and apply a pr template to my old merge requests?

# Coding Questions
How do I do the extension for using local storage? i had a long unproductive struggle trying to figure it out and i could not figure out a way without adding a lot of extra elements to my code that most likely would have affected my other code.
